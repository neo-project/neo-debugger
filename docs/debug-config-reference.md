# Neo N3 Smart Contract Debugger launch.config Reference

> Note, this document is for Neo N3 smart contract launch configurations (i.e. .NEF files).
> For information about Neo Legacy smart contract launch configurations, please see
> [this document](debug-legacy-config-reference.md).

The Neo Smart Contract Debugger enables fine grained execution control
via custom configuration settings in [launch.json](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/debugging#_launch-configurations).
This document provides information on these settings.

> Remember, the Neo Smart Contract Debugger is in preview. You will find bugs
> and/or missing functionality as you use it. Please let us know of any issues
> you find or enhancements you would like to see via our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-debugger).

## program

Absolute path to NEF file being debugged. Contract manifest (aka .manifest.json) and Debug Info (aka .nefbugnfo)
expected to be located in the same folder. 

Example:

```json
"program": "${workspaceFolder}/token-contract/bin/sc/NeoContributorTokens.nef",
```

## invocation

Describes how the contract will be invoked. Neo N3 debugger supports multiple invocation mechanisms,
described below.

### invoke operation

With this invocation, the configuration specifies the operation name and arguments to invoke. By default,
the debugger generates an invocation script for calling the specified operation with the specified
arguments from the contract specified via the `program` property. Optionally, a different contract
may be specified via the `contract` property. This is particularly useful for debugging `OnNep17Payment`
operations that are invoked as a result of a transfer operation.

```json
"invocation": {
    "operation": "mint",
    "args": [
        "Da Hongfei",
        "Founder of Neo, Chair of Neo Foundation, CEO of NGD",
        "https://neo3.azureedge.net/images/discover/DaHongfei.jpg"
    ]
}
```

### invocation file

With this invocation, the configuration specifies a path to an existing 
[Neo invoke file](https://github.com/ngdenterprise/design-notes/blob/master/NDX-DN12%20-%20Neo%20Express%20Invoke%20Files.md).
Invoke files are JSON format files, similar in structure to the [operation invocation](#invoke-operation)
described above. Invocation files are supported by both the Neo Smart Contract Debugger as well as by
[Neo Express](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-express/blob/master/docs/command-reference.md#neoxp-contract-invoke).

```json
"invocation": {
    "invoke-file": "${workspaceFolder}/invoke-files/list-nft.neo-invoke.json"
},
```

### trace-file

With this invocation, the configuration specifies a path to an existing .neo-trace file, typically
generated by [NeoTrace](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-express#neotrace) and NeoExpress (via the --trace option).
This allows debugging of transactions that executed on a public network such as MainNet or TestNet.

> Note, when using a trace file, most of the properties defined in this document are not used. `program` must still
  be specified and only `sourceFileMap`, `return-types` and `stored-contracts` optional properties are used. All
  other properties are ignored.

```json
"invocation": {
    "trace-file": "${workspaceFolder}/trace-files/0x45239b3764a0973c89c1fca6bf1ef438a462f7fb705cdf7cf1739abe48328dad.neo-trace"
}
```

### oracle-response

This invocation configuration is used to debug an oracle response callback method. 

Properties for this invocation type include:

* `url`: the url of the oracle results the debugger is simulating. `url` is a required property
  of this invocation type.
* `result`: JSON results to pass to the oracle callback operation
* `result-file`: path to a JSON file to pass to the oracle callback operation

> Either `result` or `result-file` must be specified. If both are specified, `result` is used and `result-file` is ignored

* `code`: `OracleResponseCode` to use for the response. Defaults to `Success`
* `callback`: contract operation callback to use for synthesized oracle requests
* `filter`: JSONPath filter value to use for synthesized oracle requests
* `gas`: gasForResponse value to use for synthesized oracle requests

> Neo Debugger will generate an oracle request for the contract specified in `program` property using
  the `url`, `callback`, `filter` and `gas` properties of the oracle response invocation object if
  there isn't an existing outstanding request in the specified `checkpoint`. If there is an existing
  oracle request for the specified `url`, the `callback`, `filter` and `gas` properties are ignored.

```json
"invocation": {
    "oracle-response": {
        "url": "https://some-domain.example/some/path",
        "result-file": "${workspaceFolder}/response.json",
    }
},
```

### deploy

This invocation configuration is used to debug the `_deploy` method of a contract.

```json
"invocation": "deploy",
```

## neo-express

Specifies the path to a NeoExpress file. Specifying this property enables accounts in other launch
configuration properties (such as `signers` and operation `args`) to reference accounts from the
.neo-express file via the `@` syntax (aka `@alice`) instead of requiring a Neo N3 address (aka
`NViTnvofZYshnqppD6ksCtUzBDn54an5hM`) or hex encoded 20 byte array (such as `0xccc907b1d386a52071285e580322a612e508a4f2`).

```json
"neo-express": "${workspaceFolder}/default.neo-express",
```

## checkpoint

Specifies the path to a NeoExpress checkpoint file. Specifying this property enables the debugger to 
use real blockchain data while debugging.

> Note, Neo Debugger *NEVER* updates an actual NeoExpress node instance. Contract storage changes are
  stored in memory and discarded when the debugging session ends. Each individual launch of the debugger
  starts from the same initial state. 

If this property is not set, Neo Debugger creates a stub Neo Blockchain with only the genesis block.
The debugger ensures the contract specified in `program` is deployed on the chain, but adds no other
contract storage information. By specifying a `checkpoint`, the developer can debug scenarios with
representative data stored in an actual instance of a NeoExpress node.

> Note, even when `checkpoint` is specified, the debugger still checks to ensure the latest version
  of the `program` contract is deployed. If it is not, the deployed version is updated (in memory, as
  per earlier note) to the current version on disk. This ensures the developer can always debug the
  contract as it currently exists on disk in compiled format.

```json
"checkpoint": "${workspaceFolder}/checkpoints/token-bought.neoxp-checkpoint",
```

## signers

> For more information about signers / witnesses, please see 
  [Thou shalt check their witnesses](https://neospcc.medium.com/thou-shalt-check-their-witnesses-485d2bf8375d)
  by the good folks at the [NEO Saint-Petersburg Competence Center](https://www.nspcc.ru)

Every Neo transaction that executes on the blockchain must be signed by one or more accounts. The
`signers` configuration property is used to specify signing information for the transaction executing
in the debugger.

`signers` is an array of JSON encoded signer objects. A signer can be specified as a simple string or
as a JSON object that supports additional properties.

Properties for a `signers` object include:

* `account` specifies a wallet account, as a Neo N3 address (such as `NViTnvofZYshnqppD6ksCtUzBDn54an5hM`),
  a hex encoded 20 byte array (such as `0xccc907b1d386a52071285e580322a612e508a4f2`) or an `@` prefixed
  NeoExpress wallet name such as `@alice`. The `@` prefixed syntax is only supported if the `neo-express`
  property is specified. This property is required. If the default values are sufficient for the other
  signer properties, the account string can be specified directly.
* `scopes` specifies the `WitnessScope` of the signer. `WitnessScope.CalledByEntry` scope is used by default.
* `allowedcontracts` specifies the list of contract hashes allowed by the `WitnessScope.CustomContracts` scope.
  Contract hashes can be specified by hex encoded string or deployed contract name.
* `allowedgroups` specifies the list of custom group hex-encoded public keys allowed by the `WitnessScope.CustomGroups` scope.

> Note, at this time `WitnessScope.WitnessRules` is not supported by the Neo debugger.

If no `signers` are specified, a single signer with a dummy account value and `WitnessScope.None` scope
is used. The dummy account signer will fail all `Runtime.CheckWitness` calls unless the `check-result`
config property is specified ([see below](#runtime)).

```json
"signers": [ 
    "@alice",
    {
        "account": "@bob",
        "scopes": "Global"
    }
],
```

## deploy-signer

`deploy-signer` is a signer JSON object [as described above](#signers) that is used when deploying the latest
version of the contract to the debugger stub chain. If the latest version of the contract is already deployed,
the `deploy-signer` property is not used

For [`deploy` invocations](#deploy), the debugger will use the `signers` value if specified and only use the
`deploy-signer` value as a fallback.

```json
"deploy-signer": "@owen"
```

## runtime

Specifies behavior of `Runtime.Trigger` and `Runtime.CheckWitness` members.

`Runtime.Trigger` returns either `TriggerType.Verification` or `TriggerType.Application`.
By default, the debugger return `TriggerType.Application` for `Runtime.Trigger`, but
this can be overridden by the `runtime.trigger` configuration property.

> Note, at this time only `TriggerType.Application` is supported.

`Runtime.CheckWitness` takes a Hash160 or Public key parameter and returns a boolean. The result of this
call indicates if the specified account has signed the transaction that triggered the current contract 
execution. By default, `Runtime.CheckWitness` uses the data in the blockchain and transaction signers
as it would on a production node. However, the launch configuration can override this behavior in one
of two ways.

* The configuration can specify the `runtime.witnesses.check-result` property as a boolean value that
  will be returned from `Runtime.CheckWitness`, regardless of the parameter provided.
* The configuration can specify the `runtime.witnesses` property as an array of hex encoded addresses
  or public keys. With this approach, `Runtime.CheckWitness` returns true if the provided parameter
  matches a value from the specified array

```json
"runtime": {
    "witnesses": {
        "check-result": true
    }
}
```

## stored-contracts

This property specifies a list of paths to other .NEF files that a given launch configuration may
interact with. This property enables the debugger to load the debug info for these additional contracts
to enable stepping across contract boundaries.

Note, unlike the contract specified in `program`, the Neo Debugger does NOT ensure the latest version
of the `stored-contracts` are deployed to the stub debug chain. This property is only useful in conjunction
with the `checkpoint` property, assuming the contracts listed in `stored-contracts` were deployed before
the checkpoint was created.

```json
"stored-contracts": [
    "${workspaceFolder}/store-contract/bin/sc/DemoShopContract.nef"
]
```

## storage

> Note, use of `storage` property has largely been replaced with `checkpoint`. However, it is still
  supported by the debugger.

Key/value pairs used to populate debugger's emulated storage. Similar to other
launch configuration settings, strings prefixed with `'0x'` are treated as hex-encoded
byte arrays.

If a specified key already exists in the checkpoint file, the value specified in
the launch configuration takes precedence.

JSON for the `storage` configuration setting can be generated via the Neo-Express
[`contract storage` command](https://github.com/neo-project/neo-express/blob/master/docs/command-reference.md#neo-express-contract-storage)
by using the `--json` argument.

Examples:

```json
"storage": [
    {
        "key": "neo.org",
        "value": "Neo Foundation"
    }
],

"storage": [
    {
        "key": "0x8a6f1e4f13022b26e56e957cb8251b082f0748b1007465737361",
        "value": "0x174876e800"
    },
    {
        "key": "0x796c707075536c61746f740074636172746e6f63",
        "value": "0x174876e800"
    },
    {
        "key": "0xd2cbfbe9bec47318113e4d41c95174023851df74d7cb2a9e4049d5c84d2b2a6d006f666e497874",
        "value": "0x174876e80005028a6f1e4f13022b26e56e957cb8251b082f0748b1140000000380"
    },
],
```

## return-types

Specifies the expected return type of the contract entry-point. Particularly useful
when the contract entry-point returns a C# `object`, but the specific operation
being invoked returns a strongly-typed value.

Note, it is possible for Neo smart contracts to have multiple return values.
Smart contracts compiled from C# always have a single return value, but the
configuration property name is plural and the value must be an array.

```json
"return-types": ["bool"],

"return-types": ["string"],
```

## sourceFileMap

Optional source file mappings passed to the debug engine

Example:

``` json
"sourceFileMap": {
    "C:\\foo": "/home/user/foo"
}
```
