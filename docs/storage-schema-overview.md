# Neo Smart Contract Debugger Storage Schema

Version 3.3 of the Neo Smart Contract Debugger adds support for decoding the key/item byte streams
in contract storage into higher-order types. This makes it easier for developers to understand what
is happening inside their contracts.

You can see an example of how schematized storage looks in the debugger via this screenshot:

![Storage Schema Screenshot](StorageSchemaScreenshot.png)

This screenshot comes from the [Neo Contributor NFT sample](https://github.com/ngdenterprise/neo-contrib-token)
which has been updated to enable Storage Schema. In particular, note the following:

* Single value storages are displayed in the debugger as a simple variable name + value pair. 
  For example, notice that the `TotalSupply` storage contains a single integer value 3.
* Storage map storages are displayed in the debugger as a collection. Storage map storages have one
  or more key segments with name and type information that the debugger can display to the user.
  * For single segment keys, the segment value is used as the name of the variable. For example, 
    notice how the `Token` storage uses the token ID - a hex-encoded 256 bit hash code - as the
    variable name under the top level `Token` item.
  * For multi segment keys, the key/item pairs are displayed as a collection, with key and item
    children. The key item has a child for each segment in the key, displaying that segment's name
    and value. For example, notice how the `AccountToken` storage has three key/item pairs. The
    first key/item pair has been expanded to show the key segments - `owner` and `tokenId`.
* Storage items can be primitive values such as integers and hash codes. They can also be composite
  types such as structures, arrays and maps. For example, notice how the `Token` storage values are
  `TokenState` instances, with fields such as `Owner` and `Name`.
* Storage Schema includes a primitive `Address` type. For example, notice that the `ContractOwner`
  storage item is the Neo address of the account that deployed the contract.
* The Storage Schema type model is also available for runtime types. You get a similar rich
  inspection experience for both storage and runtime types.
* Storage Schema information is included in the [debugger info](https://github.com/devhawk/proposals/blob/devhawk/cd2l/nep-19.md)
  generated by the compiler. 

## Getting Started

The easiest way to get started is to clone the [`neo-contrib-token` repo](https://github.com/ngdenterprise/neo-contrib-token)
and check out the [`storage-schema-preview` branch](https://github.com/ngdenterprise/neo-contrib-token/tree/storage-schema-preview).
That repo/branch has been updated to support Storage Schema and includes
[instructions](https://github.com/ngdenterprise/neo-contrib-token/tree/storage-schema-preview#storage-schema-preview)
for installing the Debugger preview and compiling the sample contracts.

### Neo Smart Contract Debugger Preview

The Neo Smart Contract Debugger is available from the [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ngd-seattle.neo-contract-debug).
As of v3.2, production releases have even numbered minor version numbers while preview releases have
odd minor version numbers. v3.3 of the Neo Smart Contract Debugger includes Storage Schema support.
For more details on installing preview extensions or VSCode pre-release extension support in general,
please see the [VSCode Release Notes](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_63#_pre-release-extensions).

### Neo C# Compiler + Smart Contract Framework Preview

A preview version of the Neo C# Compiler and Smart Contract Framework are available from the
[ngd Enterprise]() nuget server. 
The easiest way to access the preview compiler and framework is to use a nuget.config file. The
NFT sample repo includes a
[nuget.config file](https://github.com/ngdenterprise/neo-contrib-token/blob/storage-schema-preview/nuget.config)
that pulls the preview compiler and framework from the ngd Enterprise nuget server. More information about the
nuget.config file is available in the [official docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/nuget-config-file).

> Note, if you don't already have a nuget.config file in your project directory, you can simply
  download the one from the NFT sample repo and use it as is.

To distinguish the Storage Schema Preview versions from production, the compiler and framework
NuGet packages have a patch version number over 1000 and the prerelease tag `storage-schema-preview`.
For example, the initial Storage Schema preview release version of the compiler and framework is
`3.1.1034-storage-schema-preview`. The patch version has a base value of 1000 then adds the number
of git commits since the branch forked from master. If there is a new production release of the
compiler and framework ship during the Storage Schema preview, the preview version number will
be updated to track the production version

* The base preview patch number is the production patch number plus one and then times one thousand.
  * A theoretical 3.1.1 production release of devpack would have a base preview version of 3.1.2000.
  * A theoretical 3.2.0 production release of devpack would have a base preview version of 3.2.1000.

### Storage Schema Preview Attributes

The preview Neo C# compiler includes Storage Schema information in the .nefdbgnfo file for both runtime
and storage types. Runtime type information is derived from the C# source and requires no additional
effort aside from using the new compiler. Storage type information requires adding some custom
attributes to the contract code. More information about the conceptual storage model that informed
this design is [available below](#neo-contract-storage-conceptual-model).

> Note, this mechanism for specifying storage item schema information in code is very much a first draft.
  The approach may change drastically before final release. Feedback strongly encouraged!

The preview version of the Smart Contract Framework includes two new attributes used to generate Storage
Schema information: `StorageGroup` and `StorageKeySegment`. Here is an 
[example](https://github.com/ngdenterprise/neo-contrib-token/blob/storage-schema-preview/token-contract/NeoContributorToken.cs#L33-L53)
of their use from the NFT sample:

``` cs
[StorageGroup(typeof(BigInteger))]
const byte Prefix_TotalSupply = 0x00;

[StorageGroup("Balances", typeof(BigInteger))]
[StorageKeySegment("owner", StorageKeySegmentType.Address)]
const byte Prefix_Balance = 0x01;

[StorageGroup(typeof(BigInteger))]
const byte Prefix_TokenId = 0x02;

[StorageGroup("Tokens", typeof(TokenState))]
[StorageKeySegment("tokenId", StorageKeySegmentType.Hash256)]
const byte Prefix_Token = 0x03;

[StorageGroup(typeof(int))]
[StorageKeySegment("owner", StorageKeySegmentType.Address)]
[StorageKeySegment("tokenId", StorageKeySegmentType.Hash256)]
const byte Prefix_AccountToken = 0x04;

[StorageGroup(typeof(UInt160))]
const byte Prefix_ContractOwner = 0xFF;
```

#### StorageGroup Attribute

The StorageGroup attribute must be attached to a const prefix value defined in the SmartContract class
(i.e. the class that derives from `SmartContract`). The StorageGroup attribute specifies the type of
the storage group's value. It also optionally provides the name of the storage group. If the name is
not specified in the attribute, the name of the const field is used (with `Prefix_` removed).

The const field that a StorageGroup attribute is attached to must be a single byte or a string. The
value of the const field is used as the prefix value in storage. If the const field is a string,
the UTF8 encoding of the string is used as the storage group prefix;

> Note, C# has no mechanism for declaring a const collection of bytes except for strings. While the 
  underlying Storage Schema model allows for arbitrary multi-byte prefixes, there is currently no
  mechanism for declaring one via the StorageGroup attribute.

#### StorageKeySegment Attribute

Some storage groups only store a single value. For example, the NFT token sample above only has a single
Total Supply value and a single Contract Owner. However, most storage groups store multiple records of
related information, such as account balances or token information. To support multiple records in a given
group, each record must have a unique key value after the constant prefix. The StorageKeySegment attribute
declares the structure of key. 

Like the StorageGroup attribute, the StorageKeySegment Attribute must be applied to a const field in
the SmartContract class. Additionally, there must also be StorageGroup attribute applied to the field,
otherwise the StorageKeySegment attribute is ignored.

Each storage key segment has a name and a type. Unlike StorageGroup value types, key segments must be
a primitive type as specified in the StorageKeySegmentType enumeration. Multiple StorageKeySegment attributes
may be applied to a single const field. To enable proper key decoding, the order of StorageKeySegment
attributes must match the order of key segments in the code.

All key segments except the last one must be fixed size in order to be decoded. The final (or single)
key segment can be of variable length (ByteArray and Integer).

## Neo Contract Storage Conceptual Model

In order to understand how Storage Schema works, it is useful to understand the underlying
model of Neo contract storage. If you are an experienced Neo contract developer, you may wish to
skim or skip this section.

Neo contract storage is a key/value byte array store. Each key and value is stored as a raw array
of bytes. Any additional structure of the key or value is provided by code and is unavailable via
the storage engine.

Neo contracts typically use hard coded key prefixes to group different types of data together.
Multi-byte prefixes are also supported, but are typically only needed for contacts with more than
255 prefixes. Otherwise multi-byte prefixes are just extra storage (and associated GAS cost) with
little additional value.

> Note, there are a variety of Neo N3 samples that use strings for storage prefixes. Such samples
  should not be considered best practice. Minimizing prefix length is considered the best practice
  for Neo contract storage.

As an example, the Neo Contributor NFT sample stores six different groups of data, each with its own
[unique single byte prefix](https://github.com/ngdenterprise/neo-contrib-token/blob/main/token-contract/NeoContributorToken.cs#L32). 

``` cs
const byte Prefix_TotalSupply = 0x00;
const byte Prefix_Balance = 0x01;
const byte Prefix_TokenId = 0x02;
const byte Prefix_Token = 0x03;
const byte Prefix_AccountToken = 0x04;
const byte Prefix_ContractOwner = 0xFF;
```

Some groups of data are only a single storage value. As an example, in the NFT sample there is a
single `TotalSupply` and `ContractOwner` value. In those cases the prefix is used directly as the
storage key. You can see this in the NFT Sample `UpdateTotalSupply` method where `Prefix_TotalSupply`
is used to construct the key used to read and write a single integer value. 

``` cs
StorageContext context = Storage.CurrentContext;
byte[] key = new byte[] { Prefix_TotalSupply };

BigInteger totalSupply = (BigInteger)Storage.Get(context, key);
Storage.Put(context, key, totalSupply + 1);
```

Of course, contracts often need to store multiple pieces of data in a single group. In these cases
each data item has its own unique key. The data item's key is pre-pended with the associated hard
coded prefix in order to group all related data together in storage. The pre-pended prefix also serves
to avoid key collisions, since the the key prefix is unique to the group. Neo contract languages
typically include helper classes to make it easy to manage multiple key/value pairs within a single
prefixed group. For example, the C# Smart Contract Framework provides the `StorageMap` to simplify the
management of related data under a common key prefix.

As an example, the NFT sample stores information about multiple minted NFTs. Each NFT has a unique
256 bit hash used as the token ID. Each token has additional information (such as owner and name)
stored in contract storage, keyed by the token ID. The hard coded `Prefix_Token` byte is used to 
group all token key/values together and a `StorageMap` is used to read and write NFT information.

``` cs
StorageMap tokenMap = new StorageMap(Storage.CurrentContext, Prefix_Token);
var tokenData = tokenMap.Get(tokenId); // tokenId provided as method parameter 
TokenState token = (TokenState)StdLib.Deserialize(tokenData);
token.Owner = newOwner; // newOwner provided as method parameter 
tokenMap.Put(tokenId, StdLib.Serialize(token));
```

`StorageMap`'s Get and Put methods automatically pre-pend the prefix provided to the constructor
when reading and writing to contract storage. This makes it easy for developers to be consistent
in their use of storage prefixes.

> Note, `StorageMap` also supports indexer syntax (i.e. `tokenMap[tokenId]`) for reading and
  writing to contract storage. Many sample contacts uses this syntax rather than Get/Put.

Storage keys may also be generated from multiple individual values. As an example, the `AccountToken`
prefix in the NFT sample is used to index all the tokens owned by a given address. For this
storage group, the item key is the owner address + the token ID. The StorageMap then pre-pends
the group prefix as it does for single key items as shown above.

``` cs
StorageMap accountMap = new(Storage.CurrentContext, Prefix_AccountToken);
// combine the owner and the token ID to generate the un-prefixed key
ByteString key = owner + tokenId;
accountMap.Put(key, 0);
```

By structuring the `AccountToken` key this way, the `StorageMap` can return a list of token IDs
owned by a single address using just a couple lines of code:

``` cs
StorageMap accountMap = new StorageMap(Storage.CurrentContext, Prefix_AccountToken);
return accountMap.Find(owner, FindOptions.KeysOnly | FindOptions.RemovePrefix);
```

The `StorageMap` here is constructed just as it was for the token owner update code above.
However, instead of using the `Get` method, this sample code uses the `Find` method, returning 
a list of all the key/value pairs starting with prefix (specified via constructor parameter) and
owner (specified via method parameter). The list returned by Find is further refined by specifying
the `KeysOnly` and `RemovePrefix` options. Note, Find removes the entire prefix it used for the 
search (i.e. `Prefix_AccountToken` and `owner` in this case)

### Unified Neo Contract Type Model

As stated above, Storage Schema objects reference information about Contract Types. Contract Types
is a new richer model for describing type information than has been used in the debugger previously.
This section describes this model (along with providing a road map for upcoming improvements).

> Note, the Contract Type Model only describe information about NeoVM and storage items in order to 
  provide a better debugger experience. This model does not modify the behavior of NeoVM or how
  contract storage works in any way.

Neo compilers generate debug info that is used by the debugger. This primarily consists of information
that the NeoVM doesn't need when executing contracts. For example, the NeoVM does not need to know
the names of method parameters and variables. However, it's easier for the developer if the debugger
can automatically map NeoVM stack items back to the associated variables defined by the developer.
The debug information generated by the compiler enables this mapping.

Debug info also contains information about a variable's type. This can be used in cases to modify how
a given variable is displayed in the debugger. For example, a string variable is stored as an
immutable byte array by NeoVM. By including variable type information in the debug info, the debugger
can convert the underling NeoVM stack item into a display format more closely aligned to the code written
by the developer. For example, the immutable byte array stored by NeoVM can be converted to a string
value by the debugger.

Unfortunately, the original type model used by the debugger today was not rich enough to capture the
details needed to provide the schematized storage view shown in the screen shot above. As such, a new 
richer model for contract type information was developed. Eventually, this new contract type model will
also be used to provide richer type information for runtime items in addition to storage items.

> Note: C# declarations for the new Contract Type Model are available in the 
  [Blockchain Toolkit Library project](https://github.com/ngdenterprise/neo-blockchaintoolkit-library/blob/master/src/bctklib/models/ContractTypes.cs)

#### Primitive Type

NeoVM supports three primitive types: booleans, arbitrary sized integers and immutable byte arrays.
While booleans and integers instances have clear debugger representations, byte arrays often
represent some type of higher level type, such as a 256 bit hash, a Neo address or a string.

The Contract Type model defines the following primitive types. These types can be directly represented
as byte arrays and thus can be stored in contract storage directly without serialization

* Boolean
* Integer
* ByteArray
* String
* Hash160
* Hash256
* PublicKey
* Signature
* Address

Most of these types should be familiar to Neo contract developers. Many of these primitive types overlap
with [ContractParameterType](https://github.com/neo-project/neo/blob/master/src/neo/SmartContract/ContractParameterType.cs)
values.

One primitive type to note is the `Address` type. Under the hood, `Address` is a 160 bit hash code, just as 
`Hash160` is. However, `Address` is rendered in the debugger UI using the standard Neo address encoding, leading
to values such as `NaTtKdE8nt1E9FKKhH6hScXmDGPjgjpdhi` instead of hex encoded byte arrays. Given the prevalence
of Neo addresses in contract code, it made sense to include a specific primitive type to represent addresses and
for them to render in the most developer friendly manner possible.

One other thing to note about `Address`: Some contracts use an all-zero 160 bit hash code to represent "no
address". As an example, the NFT sample uses the all-zero address to represent an NFT without at owner. Since
the all-zero address value typically has special meaning, the debugger displays the all-zero address value in
a special way to make it easy to identify. You can see an example of this in the `TokenState.Owner` value in
the screen shot from the start of this document. The `Erik Zhang` token has `N000000000000000000000000000000000`
for the owner value. Neo addresses are base58 encoded and zero (i.e. `0`) is not a valid address character. So
by encoding what is typically an invalid address this way, it is easy to identify without risk of colliding with
a valid Neo address.

When string encoding a primitive type, the name of the primitive type is used directly. If there is a conflict
with a user defined struct name, a '#' character can be used as a prefix to disambiguate. For example, `Address`
could be a struct type defined by a contract, but `#Address` always indicates the primitive address type. If there
is no name collision, the hash character is optional. 

#### Struct Type

As described in the StructDef section above, a struct is a named heterogeneous collection of fields. Field types
may be of any type described in this type model. In order to avoid collisions with other types, struct names 
may not contain characters (to avoid collisions with primitive types) or angle brackets (to avoid collisions
with Array and Map types below).

Structs are string encoded simply by their name. As an example, see the StorageDef example above where the 
`Token` storage value type is the `TokenState` StructDef.

#### Array&lt;T> Type

> Note, while Array&lt;T> types can be specified in Storage Schema files, they are currently not handled by
  the debugger and will be displayed as if they have Unspecified type. Display of Array&lt;T>  types will
  be implemented in a future version of the debugger.

An Array&lt;T> is a homogeneous collection of items. While the underlying NeoVM Array stack type is heterogenous,
it is common for developers to consistently store a given type in a given array. The C# Smart Contract
Framework even provides a generic List&lt;T> type for homogeneous collections.

When string encoding an Array type, the type of the homogeneous collection is specified between the brackets.
The value between the brackets can be any type of Contract Type, including primitives, unspecified, structs or
even other generic array and map types.

#### Map<K,V> Type

> Note, while `Map<K,V>` types can be specified in Storage Schema files, they are currently not handled by
  the debugger and will be displayed as if they have Unspecified type. Display of `Map<K,V>` types will
  be implemented in a future version of the debugger

A Map<K, V> is a dictionary that maps a key of type K to a value of type V. This is very similar conceptually
to how contact storage works. However, please note that contract storage and Maps are fundamentally different.
A StorageDef cannot be described as a Map<K, V>. A Map<K, V> can be serialized into contract storage, but the
Map keys cannot be iterated or inspected while stored as contract storage keys can.

When string encoding a map type, the key and value types of the map are stored between the brackets and separated
by a comma. The key type of a Map<K,V> *MUST* be a primitive type. The value type can be any type of Contract type
including primitives, unspecified, structs or even other generic array and map types.

#### Interop Type

NeoVM uses a special `InteropInterface` type to integrate contract and platform code. An `InteropInterface` 
stack item wraps a .NET object such as a storage context or an iterator. The runtime `InteropInterface` item
does not provide any interrogation mechanism - you can retrieve the wrapped .NET object if you already know
its type. However, the compiler knows the type of the wrapped objects type at compile time and includes the
wrapped type information in the contract's debug info.

Note, while the compiler can determine the type of an `InteropInterface`, they are still otherwise opaque to
the debugger. The debugger does not access the wrapped .NET object or any of its fields at runtime. 

#### Unspecified Type

There are times where type information is unspecified or cannot be calculated. For those case, the `Unspecified`
type can be used. Like primitive types, the Unspecified type is simply the string `Unspecified` with an optional
hash character prefix to handle potential name collisions.

The debugger does a small amount of type validation when displaying storage and stack items. For example, if a
given item has an associated Struct type, the debugger will validate the underlying NeoVM item is an array object
(array and structs are stored the same in NeoVM) and that the struct field count matches the array count. If
there is a mismatch, the debugger will discard the type information and display the value as if the type 
were Unspecified.
